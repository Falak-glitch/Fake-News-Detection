# Fake-News-Detection
There seems to be increasing issue in recent years that disinformation on social networks is harming communities and institutions of democracy. In turn, steps have been declared by social networking sites to restrict the dissemination of fake news. The widespread of false content has the capacity to have highly negative effects on people and community. Consequently, identification of false information on social media is an evolving science now a days that is drawing great attention.
I made a fake news detection project based out of basic machine learning classification Algorithm using Textual characteristics and cleaning the text data based on removing stop words, extra punctuation, removing contractions(converting I'd to I would), tokenizing the data and other text cleaning techniques initially. After cleaning the data, we processed the data based on the binary classes that are fake news or not. We tried multiple classifiers like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random forest. 
In this work, fake news detection is performed using proficient algorithm Random Forest on text based dataset of Kaggle. When it comes to comparison, Random forest yields better outcome.
The best solution which we got was using an ensemble technique. 
We followed some research on internet and after combing through various methods we learned from this project both about how classification works and how to deal with text in data science problems.
